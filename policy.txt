When signing PGP/GPG keys, you are stating that you've inserted a level of
trust with the owner of the key. This trust is necessary for the OpenPGP
ecosystem, as OpenPGP is a distributed system that does not rely on a central
authority, such as Verisign. Thus, the more signatures that exist in a single
key, the more that key can be trusted. The more keys that contain signatures
and sign each others keys, the larger the Web of Trust.

It's important to understand that signing each others PGP/GPG keys means you
trust them. However, it's possible that we've gotten a little over zealous in
the process. Really, is it necessary to check identification, even if you
already know the individual? Of course, it's important to make sure that you
have the right key in your possession, so exchanging fingerprints is probably a
good idea, but if it's my brother or boss, is verifying their identification
really that important?

One thing to remember, is that you are only verifying identity, not
identification. It's not critical knowing whether or not the person can drive
or travel out of the country. It's only important to verify their identity. Of
course, if you don't know them, then using some government-issued
identification is important.

When using GnuPG to sign someone's key, you will be asked how careful you have
checked their identity. The responses are as follows:

0. I will not answer. (default)
1. I have not checked at all.
2. I have done casual checking.
3. I have done very careful checking.

Personally, I will only sign keys if I have done at least casual checking or
very careful checking. I will not sign a key if I have not verified the
ownership of the key. This weakens the Web of Trust. With that said, if you're
interested in receiving a PGP/GPG signature from me, you can take one of the
following steps below, and I will sign your key:

I have done very careful checking.
==================================


* I will sign your key if we meet in person and exchange 2 forms of ID, 
    including at least one government-issued identification and 
    key fingerprints if we don't know each other.
* I will sign your key if we cannot meet in person but someone I ultimately
      trust notifies me that you want a signature, and gives me your key id
      verbally or in person.
* I will sign your key without meeting in person and without exchanging
      identification and key fingerprints if I know you very well personally
      (family, known you for more than 5 years, etc.)
      

I have done casual checking.
============================

1. Authentication by sending my a scan of your United States passport or driver
    license

* Make a color scan of your personal United States passport or driver's
      license.
* On the color scan, hand write your email address and your key id.
* Compose an email with the resulting document, and digitally sign it
      with your key.
* Send the email to: tristor@gmail.com

  Of course, sending me a copy of your passport or driver's license could
  have some identity fraud ramifications. I am certainly not interested in
  committing identity fraud, but to be assured, you can black out your
  address, social security number, birthday, passport number and/or
  driver's license number. Basically, I only need enough information to
  identify the the document and your name. Because we aren't meeting
  face-to-face, the photo isn't necessary. I'll remain in contact with you,
  if too much of the document has been removed, or the scan is unclear, or
  whatever. Please encrypt the mail and the scans so I am the only one who
  sees the information. I will securely shred, both physically and
  digitally, any unencrypted copies, should they be needed.


2. Authentication by video-conference and challenge response.

* Send me a signed and encrypted email using the key you want signed from 
    the email associated with the uid you want signed.
* In the email include a code-word and a username for either Google Hangouts
     or Skype.
* I will reply with an email signed and encrypted to the public key and uid
     with an opposing code-word and my Google Hangouts or Skype username.
* I will connect to you on Skype or Google Hangouts shortly thereafter where 
    you will verbally state the code-word I sent you.  I will then verbally 
    state the code-word you sent me.
* You will verbally confirm the full fingerprint of your key.


I greatly prefer meeting face-to-face for keysignings, so if at all possible I
would rather arrange that.
